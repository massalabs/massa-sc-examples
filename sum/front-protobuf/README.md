# Massa Front-End Example: Sum

Welcome to the repository for the Sum smart contract's front-end application, developed on the Massa platform. For a comprehensive understanding of Massa smart contracts, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.massa.net/en/latest/web3-dev/massa-web3.html).

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have NodeJs installed on your system. Follow the instructions provided [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for installation.

- Before diving in, ensure you have installed MassaStation on your system. Follow the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/massalabs/station/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) for installation.

- You also need to have the wallet plugin installed in massa station. To do that, go to the massa station module page by clicking the right arrow and on the wallet plugin install button.


### Clone the Repository
After setting up MassaStation, clone this repository
`git clone git@github.com:massalabs/massa-sc-examples.git`

### Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies with the following command:
`npm install`

## Running the Application

The following npm commands are available to run in your project directory:

### Start the Application

`npm start`


This command runs the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in your browser. The application reloads if you make changes to the source files.

### Run Tests

`npm test`


This command launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more details, check out the Create React App [documentation on running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### Build for Production

`npm run build`


This command builds the application for production use, optimizing for the best performance. The build is minified and includes hashed filenames. For deployment instructions, refer to the Create React App [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### Ejecting

`npm run eject`


**Warning:** Ejecting is a permanent operation!

If the build tool and configuration do not meet your project needs, you can use `npm run eject` to expose all the configuration files and dependencies. This allows for full customization. Remember, this action is irreversible!
