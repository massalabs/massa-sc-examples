# Async Calls

This repository contains a basic example of a dApp Async Calls. A Smart Contract that calls another Smart Contract in an asynchronous way.

You'll find in [contracts](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-examples/tree/main/asynccalls/contracts)
the smart-contract logic used to implement the game and in the
[html](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-examples/tree/main/asynccalls/front) folder the front-end used to
interact with the smart-contract developed using the [massa-wallet-provider](https://github.com/massalabs/wallet-provider) and [massa-web3](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-web3) library.
