## Contracts showcase

In this section you will find examples of smart contracts showcasing usage of objects available in the `massa-as-sdk` package.

Each of the examples has a `assembly/contracts` folder containing the smart contract codes and a `interaction.ts` file that contains all the deployment and interaction with the smart contract.

You can go to any folder copy the `.env.example` to a `.env` add your secret key, update the RPC if you don't want to use buildnet and run `npm run start`. It will run all the actions in the `interaction.ts`
