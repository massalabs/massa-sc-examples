# Massa Front-End Example: autonomousprice

Welcome to the repository for the autonomousprice smart contract's front-end application, developed on the Massa platform. For a comprehensive understanding of Massa smart contracts, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.massa.net/en/latest/web3-dev/massa-web3.html).

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Ensure you have NodeJs installed on your system. Follow the instructions provided [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for installation.

-   Before diving in, ensure you have installed MassaStation on your system. Follow the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/massalabs/station/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) for installation.

### Clone the Repository

After setting up MassaStation, clone this repository
`git clone git@github.com:massalabs/massa-sc-examples.git`

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies with the following command:
`npm install`

## Running the Application

The following npm commands are available to run in your project directory:

### Start the Application

`npm start`

This command runs the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in your browser. The application reloads if you make changes to the source files.

### Run Tests

`npm test`

This command launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more details, check out the Create React App [documentation on running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### Build for Production

`npm run build`

This command builds the application for production use, optimizing for the best performance. The build is minified and includes hashed filenames. For deployment instructions, refer to the Create React App [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### Ejecting

`npm run eject`

**Warning:** Ejecting is a permanent operation!

If the build tool and configuration do not meet your project needs, you can use `npm run eject` to expose all the configuration files and dependencies. This allows for full customization. Remember, this action is irreversible!
