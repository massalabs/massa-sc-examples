/**
 * This file is a smart contract that enables you to store and retrieve the age of a person by their name.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The smart contract is written in AssemblyScript and executed on the Massa blockchain.
 *
 * The contract has three functions:
 *
 * - The constructor sets up the storage by creating an initial entry for a person with a default age value.
 *  This function is always called once on contract deployment.
 *
 * - The change_age function allows you to update a person's age by providing their name and a new age value.
 *  If the entry for the given name does not exist, the person is created.
 *  This function generates an event that indicates the changes that are made.
 *
 * - The get_age function retrieves the age of a person by their name.
 *  If the entry for the given name does not exist, the execution is aborted.
 *  This function returns the serialized 'age' found, and generates an event that indicates the retrieval.
 *
 * The smart contract interacts with the Massa blockchain using the massa-as-sdk,
 * which provides functions for storage, access control, event generation and more.
 * @see [massa-as-sdk](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-as-sdk)
